# If, else practice
## building a calculator
build calculator that takes three inputs from the user
2 inputs as numbers (floats)

# Lists
Composite Data Type, meaning multiple data types can be stored in one variable. 
Each piece is called an element.

# Loops

Like Post Malone describes, "Run Away, but we're running in circles"
Used to repeat a block of code multiple times until a certain condition is met.

DRY Coding Principle: Don't Repeat Yourself

Example: Counting coins in your piggy bank
'If' condition would decide whether or not to run the intended block. whereas,
Loops would decide how many times the user wants t run the intended block


# While loop
While the condition is met, keep executing the intended block. If not met, skip the block.

Things to consider:
    - Program can enter the loop
    Program can exit the loop
