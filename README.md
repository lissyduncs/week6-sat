# If, else practice
## building a calculator
build calculator that takes three inputs from the user
2 inputs as numbers (floats)

# Lists
Composite Data Type, meaning multiple data types can be stored in one variable. 
Each piece is called an element.

# Loops

Like Post Malone describes, "Run Away, but we're running in circles"
Used to repeat a block of code multiple times until a certain condition is met.

DRY Coding Principle: Don't Repeat Yourself

Example: Counting coins in your piggy bank
'If' condition would decide whether or not to run the intended block. whereas,
Loops would decide how many times the user wants t run the intended block


# While loop
While the condition is met, keep executing the intended block. If not met, skip the block.

Things to consider:
    - Program can enter the loop
    Program can exit the loop
    
# range
Its a pre-defined function that generates a sequence of numbers.
Useful: Loops for iterating a specific number of times over a sequence of numbers.

range(start, stop, step)


## For Loop
For each item in a sequence, execute the intended statements.

for variable_name in sequence:
 stmts

## Practice Example 1
Finding the sum of the first ten numbers (1, 2, ... 10)

## Practice Example 2 
Find the largest number in the list
list = [3, 41, 12, 9, 74, 15]


# Loop Control Statements
Control the flow of the loop, terminate the loop early if you want or skip over some iteration

## Break statement
Terminates loop immediately, moves to the next statement after the loop.

## Continue statement
Skips the rest of the code inside the loop for the current iteration and moves to the next iteration.
